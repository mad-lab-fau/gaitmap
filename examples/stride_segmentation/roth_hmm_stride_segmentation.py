BarthDtw stride segmentation
============================

This example illustrates how subsequent DTW implemented by the :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw` can be
used to detect strides in a continuous signal of an IMU signal.
The used implementation is based on the work of Barth et al [1]_ and adds a set of postprocessing methods that aim to
reduce the chance of false positives.

# %%
# Getting some example data
# --------------------------
#
# For this we take some example data that contains the regular walking movement during a 2x20m walk test of a healthy
# subject. The IMU signals are already rotated so that they align with the gaitmap SF coordinate system.
# The data contains information from two sensors - one from the right and one from the left foot.
from gaitmap.example_data import get_healthy_example_imu_data

data = get_healthy_example_imu_data()
sampling_rate_hz = 204.8
data.sort_index(axis=1).head(1)

# %%
# Selecting a template
# --------------------
# This library ships with the template that was originally used by Barth et al.
# It is generated based on manually segmented strides from healthy participants and PD patients.
# This template is used by default by :class:`~gaitmap.stride_segmentation.BarthDtw`, but we will load it manually in
# this example.
from gaitmap.stride_segmentation import BarthOriginalTemplate

template = BarthOriginalTemplate()
template.get_data().plot()
plt.xlabel("Time [#]")
plt.ylabel("gyro [deg/s]")
plt.show()

# %%
# Preparing the data
# ------------------
# The template only makes use of the gyro information.
# Further, if you use this template in the DTW, your data is expected to be in the gaitmap BF to be able to use the
# same template for the left and the right foot.
# Therefore, we need to transform the dataset into the body frame.
from gaitmap.utils.coordinate_conversion import convert_to_fbf

# We use the `..._like` parameters to identify the data of the left and the right foot based on the name of the sensor.
bf_data = convert_to_fbf(data, left_like="left_", right_like="right_")

# %%
# Applying the DTW
# ----------------
# First we need to initialize the DTW.
# In most cases it is sufficient to keep all parameters at default.
# However, if you experience any issues you should start modifying the parameters, starting by `max_cost`,
# as it has the highest influence on the result.
from gaitmap.stride_segmentation import BarthDtw

dtw = BarthDtw(template=template)
# Apply the dtw to the data
dtw = dtw.segment(data=bf_data, sampling_rate_hz=sampling_rate_hz)

# %%
# Inspecting the results
# ----------------------
# The main output is the `stride_list_`, which contains the start and the end of all identified strides.
# As we passed a dataset with two sensors, the output will be a dictionary.
stride_list_left = dtw.stride_list_["left_sensor"]
print("{} strides were detected.".format(len(stride_list_left)))
stride_list_left.head()

# %%
# To get a better understanding of the results, we can plot additional information about the results.
# The top row shows the `gyr_ml` axis with the segmented strides plotted on top.
# They are postprocessed to snap to the closed data minimum.
# In the second row the cost function of the DTW is plotted.
# Each minimum marks a potential end of a stride.
# The black dotted line indicates the used `max_cost` threshold to search for stride candidates.
# The drawn boxes show the raw result of the DTW without the snap-to-min postprocessing.
# The third row shows the entire accumulated cost matrix and the path each stride takes through the cost matrix to
# achieve minimal cost.
#
# Only the first couple of strides of the left foot are shown.
