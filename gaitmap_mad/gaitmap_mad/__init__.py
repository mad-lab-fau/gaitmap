"""Specific algorithm implementations by the mad_lab team.

Compared to the normal gaitmap module, all algorithms here are licensed under the AGPL license.
Please make sure you understand the implications of this license before you use the algorithms.

Further, this library does not manage its own dependencies, and you need to install `gaitmap` itself to use this
library.
Note, that we only support using the exact same version of the gaitmap library.
