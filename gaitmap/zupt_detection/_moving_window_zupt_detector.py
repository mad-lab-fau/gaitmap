class NormZuptDetector(BaseZuptDetector, PerSampleZuptDetectorMixin):
    """Detect ZUPTs based on either the Acc or the Gyro norm.

    The ZUPT method uses a sliding window approach with overlap.
    For overlapping windows the results will be combined with a logical "or" in the region of the overlap.
    I.e. if one of the overlapping windows is considered static, the entire region is.
    Neighboring static windows will be combined to a static region.

    All calculations are always performed on the norm of the selected sensor.

    At the moment only single sensor data is supported.

    .. note::
        Using the gyro signal with the metric "squared_mean" and a window overlap of len(window) - 1 samples, this ZUPT
        detector is equivalent to the ARED Zupt detector presented in [1]_.
        We also provide the :class:`~gaitmap.zupt_detection.AredZuptDetector` class for convenience that has these
        values as default.

    .. warning::
        Due to edge cases at the end of the input data where window size and overlap might not fit your data, the last
        window might be discarded for analysis and will therefore always be considered as non-static!

    Parameters
    ----------
    sensor
        The sensor (either `acc` or `gyr`) to apply the detection to.
        The detector will calculate the norm for the respective sensor.
    window_length_s : int
        Length of desired window in seconds.
        The real window length is calculated as `window_length_samples = round(sampling_rate_hz * window_length_s)`
    window_overlap : float
        The overlap between two neighboring windows as a fraction of the window length.
        Must be `0 <= window_overlap < 1`.
        Note that the window length is first converted into samples, before the effective overlap is calculated.
        The overlap in samples is calculated as `overlap_samples = round(window_length_samples * window_overlap)`.

        When `window_overlap` is specified, `window_overlap_samples` must be `None`.
    window_overlap_samples : int
        The overlap between two neighboring windows in samples.
        This can be used as alternative to `window_overlap`, when you want to set the overlap independent of the
        sampling rate.
        The values can be negative.
        In this case, it will be interpreted as len(window_length_samples) - window_overlap_samples.
        This can be helpful if you want to set the overlap to the maximum possible value.
        Then set `window_overlap_samples` to -1.

        When `window_overlap_samples` is specified, `window_overlap` must be `None`.
    inactive_signal_threshold : float
       Threshold to decide whether a window should be considered as active or inactive.
       Window will be tested on `metric(norm_window) <= threshold`.
       The unit of this value depends on the selected sensor and metric.
    metric : str
        Metric which will be calculated per window on the norm of the signal, one of the following strings

        'mean' (default)
            Calculates mean value per window
        'squared_mean'
            The same as mean, but the norm of the signal is squared before calculating the mean.
        'maximum'
            Calculates maximum value per window
        'median'
            Calculates median value per window
        'variance'
            Calculates variance value per window

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    data
        The data passed to the detect method
    sampling_rate_hz
        The sampling rate of this data

    Attributes
    ----------
    zupts_
        A dataframe with the columns `start` and `end` specifying the start and end of all static regions in samples
    per_sample_zupts_
        A bool array with length `len(data)`.
        If the value is `True` for a sample, it is part of a static region.
    window_length_samples_
        The internally calculated window length in samples.
        This might be helpful for debugging.
    window_overlap_samples_
        The internally calculated window overlap in samples.
        This might be helpful for debugging.
    min_vel_index_
        The index of the sample with the minimum velocity.
        This is calculated as the center of the window with the minimum velocity.
    min_vel_value_
        The minimum velocity value.
        This is calculated as the value of the window with the minimum velocity.
        If no window is below the threshold, this value is `np.nan`.
        Note, that in this case, min_vel_index is still set to a proper value.

    This is based on the papers [1]_ and [2]_ and uses as weighted sum of the gravity corrected acc and the gyro norm to
    detect the static moments.

    .. note:: The threshold is heavily dependent on the provided noise levels of the sensors.
              These values should theoretically be provided in the datasheet of the sensors, but most of the times, it
              makes sense to grid search the value, as the effective noise level might vary quite a bit.
