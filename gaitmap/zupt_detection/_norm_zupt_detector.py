class NormZuptDetector(BaseZuptDetector):
    """Detect ZUPTs based on either the Acc or the Gyro norm.

    The ZUPT method uses a sliding window approach with overlap.
    For overlapping windows the results will be combined with a logical "or" in the region of the the overlap.
    I.e. if one of the overlapping windows is considered static, the entire region is.
    Neighboring static windows will be combined to a static region.

    All calculations are always performed on the norm of the selected sensor.

    At the moment only single sensor data is supported.

    .. warning::
        Due to edge cases at the end of the input data where window size and overlap might not fit your data, the last
        window might be discarded for analysis and will therefore always be considered as non-static!

    Parameters
    ----------
    sensor
        The sensor (either `acc` or `gyr`) to apply the detection to.
        The detector will calculate the norm for the respective sensor.
    window_length_s : int
        Length of desired window in seconds.
        The real window length is calculated as `window_length_samples = round(sampling_rate_hz * window_length_s)`
    window_overlap : float
        The overlap between two neighboring windows as a fraction of the window length.
        Must be `0 <= window_overlap < 1`.
        Note that the window length is first converted into samples, before the effective overlap is calculated.
        The overlap in samples is calculated as `overlap_samples = round(window_length_samples * window_overlap)`
    inactive_signal_threshold : float
       Threshold to decide whether a window should be considered as active or inactive.
       Window will be tested on `metric(norm_window) <= threshold`.
       The unit of this values depends on the selected sensor and metric.
    metric : str
        Metric which will be calculated per window on the norm of the signal, one of the following strings

        'mean' (default)
            Calculates mean value per window
        'maximum'
            Calculates maximum value per window
        'median'
            Calculates median value per window
        'variance'
            Calculates variance value per window

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    data
        The data passed to the detect method
    sampling_rate_hz
        The sampling rate of this data

    Attributes
    ----------
    zupts_
        A dataframe with the columns `start` and `end` specifying the start and end of all static regions in samples
    per_sample_zupts_
        A bool array with length `len(data)`.
        If the value is `True` for a sample, it is part of a static region.
    window_length_samples_
        The internally calculated window length in samples.
        This might be helpful for debugging
    window_overlap_samples_
        The internally calculated window overlap in samples.
        This might be helpful for debugging.
