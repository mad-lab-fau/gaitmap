    ----------
    data
        The raw IMU data that should be used for snapping. Should be a 1D numpy array
    matches_start_end
        The actual stride candidates as 2D np.array
    snap_to_min_win_samples
        If a single integer is provided, this is the size of the window that should be searched for the closest
        extrema in samples.
        The window is assumed to be centered around the start/end value of the match (i.e. the search radius is half
        the window size)
        If a tuple of two integers is provided, the window is assumed to be asymmetric and the first value is the
        search radius to the left of the start/end value and the second value is the search radius to the right of
        the start/end value.
        Note: In case you need different search intervals for the start and end values of a stride, you can call this
        function twice, only with the start or end values of the stride candidates and change the search radius
        accordingly.
