class RtsKalman(BaseTrajectoryMethod):
    """An Error-State-Kalman-Filter (ESKF) with Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing for trajectory estimation.

    This algorithm employs an ESKF to estimate a trajectory and velocity profile
    from acceleration and gyroscope data.
    It does three passes over the data, where in the first one the data is integrated and the current error in position,
    velocity and orientation is tracked with an extended kalman filter.
    This filter uses a linearized transition matrix in the prediction phase and Zero-Velocity-Updates (ZUPT) in its
    update phase.
    In the second pass RTS smoothing is applied to the previously estimated error states and error covariances and in
    the thrid pass the smoothed error states are applied as correction to the integrated nominal states from the first
    pass.

    This method is expected to be run on long sections of data including multiple strides.

    The implementation of the RTS smoothing is based on the paper [1]_.
    The error state kalman filter part itself is based on the paper [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_orientation
        The initial orientation of the sensor that is assumed.
        It is critical that this value is close to the actual orientation.
        If you pass an array, remember that the order of elements must be x, y, z, w.
    zupt_variance
        The variance of the noise of the measured velocity during a ZUPT.
        As we are typically pretty sure, that the velocity should be zero then, this should be very small.
    velocity_error_variance
        The variance of the noise present in the velocity error.
        Should be based on the sensor accelerometer noise.
    orientation_error_variance
        The variance of the noise present in the orientation error.
        Should be based on the sensor gyroscope noise.
        The orientation error is internally not represented as quaternion, but as axis-angle representation,
        which also explains the unit of rad^2 for this variance.
    level_walking
        Flag to control if the level walking assumptions should be used during ZUPTs.
        If this is True, additionally to the velocity, the z position is reset to zero during a ZUPT.
    level_walking_variance
        The variance of the noise of the measured position during a level walking update.
        Should typically be very small.
    zupt_detector
        An instance of a valid Zupt detector that will be used to find ZUPTs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    orientation_
        The rotations as a *SingleSensorOrientationList*, including the initial orientation.
        This means the there are len(data) + 1 orientations.
    orientation_object_
        The orientations as a single scipy Rotation object
    position_
        The calculated positions
    velocity_
        The calculated velocities
    covariance_
        The covariance matrices of the kalman filter after smoothing.
        They can be used as a measure of how good the filter worked and how accurate the results are.
    zupts_
        2D array indicating the start and the end samples of the detected ZUPTs for debug porpuses.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    data
        The data passed to the estimate method
    sampling_rate_hz
        The sampling rate of this data

    Notes
    -----
    The default values chosen for the noise parameters and the ZUPT-threshold are optimized based on NilsPod recordings
    with healthy subjects.
    If you are using a different sensor system or other cohorts, it is advisable to readjust these parameter values.
    When adjusting the variance of the three different noises for velocity error, orientation error and zupts,
    the relation between those values is much more important, than the absolute values assigned.
    As long as the quotient between them is kept about the same and `zupt_threshold_dps` is not changed,
    similar results are expected.

    This class uses *Numba* as a just-in-time-compiler to achieve fast run times.
    In result, the first execution of the algorithm will take longer as the methods need to be compiled first.

class MadgwickRtsKalman(RtsKalman):
    """An extention of the RTS Kalman filter that uses the Madgwick filter for orientation estimation.

    This method is basically identical to the normal :class:`~gaitmap.trajectory_reconstruction.RtsKalman` filter,
    but uses the Madgwick filter for orientation estimation.
    This should provide more robust orientation updates during long regions without ZUPTs.
    The influence of the Madgwick filter can be controlled by the `madgwick_beta` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_orientation
        The initial orientation of the sensor that is assumed.
        It is critical that this value is close to the actual orientation.
        If you pass an array, remember that the order of elements must be x, y, z, w.

    zupt_detector
        An instance of a valid Zupt detector that will be used to find ZUPTs.
    madgwick_beta
        The beta parameter of the Madgwick filter.
        This parameter controls how harsh the acceleration based correction is.
        A high value performs large corrections and a small value small and gradual correction.
        A high value should only be used if the sensor is moved slowly.
        A value of 0 is identical to just the Gyro Integration (i.e. identical to the
        :class:`~gaitmap.trajectory_reconstruction.RtsKalman`).

    orientation_object_
        The orientations as a single scipy Rotation object
    position_
