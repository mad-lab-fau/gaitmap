# gaitmap - The Gait and Movement Analysis Package

*gaitmap* provides a set of algorithms to analyze your IMU movement data (with a focus on foot-worn IMUs) without 
getting into your way.

- üíª [20+ Algorithms](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/index.html) from 17+ publications
- üìö Extensive [documentation](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- üìù Build to be [easily extendable](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/create_own_algorithm.html)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Familiar API inspired by scikit-learn
- ü§ù Interoperable with the other libraries from the gaitmap ecosystem ([gaitmap-dataset](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap-datasets), [tpcp](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/tpcp), ...)

**Documentation:** [gaitmap.readthedocs.io](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README.html)<br>
**Learn more about the gaitmap ecosystem:** [the gaitmap ecosystem](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/gaitmap_ecosystem.html)

## Installation

Gaitmap is split into two packages: `gaitmap` and `gaitmap_mad` ([Learn more](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/gaitmap_mad.html)).
To get access to all available algorithms, you need to install both packages:

```bash
pip install gaitmap gaitmap_mad --upgrade
```

Both packages are always released together and have the same version number.
We don't recommend mixing different versions of `gaitmap` and `gaitmap_mad`.

**Note:** gaitmap-mad is published under a AGPL-3.0 license, while gaitmap is published under a MIT license.
Please, check the [License](#license) section below for more details.

In case you are sure that AGPL-3.0 is compatible with your project, you can install `gaitmap_mad` without any downsides.
Otherwise, just install `gaitmap` and check the API-docu page of the individual algorithms if they are available in
`gaitmap` only.

### Installing from Github

If you want to install the latest version from Github, you can use the following command:

```bash
# For gaitmap
pip install "git+https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap.git" --upgrade
# For gaitmap_mad
pip install "git+https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap.git#subdirectory=gaitmap_mad"
```

Note, that we don't guarantee that the latest version on Github is stable.

### Enabling specific features

#### Hidden Markov Models

To use the HMM (anything imported from `gaitmap.stride_segmentation.hmm`) based algorithms make sure you install `gaitmap` with the `hmm` extra.

```bash
pip install gaitmap_mad "gaitmap[hmm]" --upgrade
```
This installs the `pomegranate` package, which is the basis for the HMM implementation.
Note, that we only support the `pomegranate` version `>=0.14.2,<=0.14.6` and that `pomegrante` is not compatible with 
Python 3.10.

We are working on upgrading to a newer version of `pomegranate`, but this is not a priority at the moment.
You can track the progress in the [pull request](https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap/pull/20).

### Supported Python versions

*gaitmap* is tested against Python 3.9 at the moment.
We expect most features to work with all Python versions >= 3.9, but because of some known issues 
(see specific features above) we do not officially support them.

## Working with Algorithms

*gaitmap* is designed to be a toolbox and not a single algorithm.
This means, that you are expected to pick and use individual algorithms.

To get started with *gaitmap* we recommend to follow these steps:

1. Have a look at our example to get an understanding of what *gaitmap* can do: [Example](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html)
2. Understand the common datatypes we use: [Common Datatypes](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/datatypes.html), [Coordinate Systems](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/coordinate_systems.html)
3. Learn how to prepare your own data (or play around with example data): [Prepare Data](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/prepare_data.html) 
4. Check the API docs and examples for available algorithms: [API Docs](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/index.html), [Examples](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html)

Each algorithm is implemented as a class, which is initialized with the required parameters.
In many cases the default parameters are sufficient, but to get the best results on your data, you should adapt them.

```python
from gaitmap.stride_segmentation import BarthDtw

stride_segmenter = BarthDtw(max_cost=2.5)
```

After initialization, you can apply the algorithm to your data (each group of algorithm has a different action method):

```python
my_imu_data = ...
stride_segmenter.segment(my_imu_data, sampling_rate_hz=204.8)
```

Results are stored as parameters of the algorithm object (with a trailing underscore):

```python
segmented_strides = stride_segmenter.stride_list_
```

Most algorithms have additional results available to provide further information.

```python
dtw_warping_path = stride_segmenter.paths_
```

To build a full gait analysis pipeline you can combine multiple algorithms ([Example](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/full_pipelines/mad_gait_pipeline.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-full-pipelines-mad-gait-pipeline-py)).
You can even substitute your own algorithms ([Guide](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/user_guide/create_own_algorithm.html)) or use the provided tooling to validate
and optimize your algorithms using tpcp ([General Guide](https://tpcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index.html#optimization-and-validation), [Example](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/datasets_and_pipelines/gridsearch.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-datasets-and-pipelines-gridsearch-py)).

## For Developers

The [Development Guides](https://gaitmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/development/index.html#development) have detailed information for all new developers.

Here some quick references
Install Python >=3.8 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
Then run the commands below to get the latest source and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mad-lab-fau/gaitmap.git
# For Python 3.8 and 3.9 (and if you need to work on hmm)
poetry install --all-extras
# For Python >=3.10 (you can not work on hmm stuff with this)
poetry install -E stats
```

Warning: Building the docs currently only works in 3.8 and 3.9 with all extras installed.

Note, that you don't need to care about the `gaitmap_mad` subpackage.
All dependencies are specified in the main `pyproject.toml` and the `gaitmap_mad` will be installed in editable mode
when running `poetry install`.

To run any of the tools required for the development workflow, use the poe commands:

```bash
poetry run poe
